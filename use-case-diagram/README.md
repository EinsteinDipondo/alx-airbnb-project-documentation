# üè° Use Case Diagram ‚Äî Airbnb Clone Backend Documentation

This directory contains the Use Case Diagram and supporting README for the "alx-airbnb-project-documentation" ‚Äî the System Analysis & Design phase for an Airbnb Clone backend.

## Project overview
The documentation in this repository captures the pre-development artifacts for a scalable, secure, and robust RESTful API backend for an Airbnb-like application. It simulates a real-world SDLC where design and planning precede implementation.

### Project goal
Translate high-level requirements into a complete, developer-ready blueprint for a RESTful API backend that supports:
- Secure authentication and authorization (JWT, RBAC)
- PostgreSQL-backed persistence
- Payment integration (e.g., Stripe)
- Scalable, testable, and maintainable architecture

---

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities & Technical Scope
Planned domains and highlights:
- **User Management** ‚Äî Authentication, authorization, profile management (Guests, Hosts, Admin).
- **Property Listings** ‚Äî Host CRUD, availability, search & filtering.
- **Booking Management** ‚Äî Reservation creation, date validation, cancellations.
- **Payments & Financials** ‚Äî Payment gateway integration and host payouts.
- **Reviews & Notifications** ‚Äî Review system and transactional notifications (email/in-app).

## Use Case Diagram
- File path: `use-case-diagram/use_case_diagram.png`  
- Description: Visual representation of the system boundary, primary actors (Unregistered User, Guest, Host, Admin, Payment Gateway), and their main goals (e.g., Log In, Create Listing, Submit Payment).

## How to review
1. Clone the repository or browse on GitHub.
2. Open `use-case-diagram/use_case_diagram.png` to inspect the diagram.
3. Refer to `features-and-functionalities/features_and_functionalities_overview.png` for the feature map that complements the use case diagram.

---

## What's next
- Convert the Use Case Diagram into UML actors & use cases in the design docs, if desired.
- Draft user stories and API specifications (pending).
- Link use cases to concrete API endpoints and database entities during the design-to-implementation handoff.
