üè° Airbnb Clone Backend Documentation (alx-airbnb-project-documentation)

This repository serves as the System Analysis and Design documentation phase for the backend of an Airbnb Clone application. It contains all the necessary pre-development artifacts‚Äîincluding feature lists, technical diagrams, user stories, data models, and API specifications‚Äîthat guide the subsequent engineering and implementation phases.

üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective of this documentation project is to translate high-level requirements into a complete, structured, and developer-ready blueprint for a scalable, secure, and robust RESTful API backend.

This process simulates a real-world Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where comprehensive planning precedes coding.

‚ú® Core Functionalities & Technical Scope

The planned backend system will support the following key domains, ensuring adherence to modern technical standards (JWT, PostgreSQL, Stripe integration, etc.):

User Management: Secure authentication, authorization (RBAC), and profile management for Guests and Hosts.

Property Listings: CRUD operations for Hosts, advanced search, filtering, and availability management for Guests.

Booking Management: Reservation creation, date validation, and cancellation tracking.

Payments & Financials: Integration with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for upfront payments and host payouts.

Reviews & Notifications: System for submitting reviews, host responses, and transactional notifications (email/in-app).

üìù Documentation Artifacts

The following documents and diagrams will be produced as part of this project, organized into their respective directories:
