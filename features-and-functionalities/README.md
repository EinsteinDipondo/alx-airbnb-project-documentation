## Project Goal

Build a developer-ready blueprint (pre-development artifacts) for a scalable, secure, and robust RESTful API backend that models a production-ready Airbnb clone. This documentation simulates a real-world SDLC phase prior to implementation, translating product requirements into technical designs and API contracts.

---

## Core Functionalities & Technical Scope

The backend will implement a set of core domains and technical patterns typical for a production-grade accommodation marketplace.

### User Management
- Secure authentication: JWT-based token flow (access + refresh tokens).
- Authorization: Role-based access control (Guest, Host, Admin).
- Profile management: user profiles, verification statuses, KYC placeholders.

### Property Listings
- Hosts can create/update/delete/list properties.
- Rich metadata: photos, amenities, rules, house manual.
- Availability & pricing models: base price, seasonal adjustments, cleaning fees.
- Search & filtering: location, date availability, price range, amenities, rating.

### Booking Management
- Reservation lifecycle: availability checks, booking hold/confirm, cancellations, modifications.
- Date validation: conflict checks, minimum/maximum stay rules.
- Booking states and history for guests/hosts.

### Payments & Financials
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe-compatible flow): authorizations, captures, refunds.
- Host payouts, platform fees, and payout scheduling.
- Financial reports & reconciliations (design-level).

### Reviews & Notifications
- Reviews and ratings for properties and hosts.
- Host responses to reviews.
- Transactional notifications: email (templates), in-app notifications, webhooks.

### Admin & Analytics
- Admin dashboards & moderation controls (listing takedowns, user suspension).
- Audit logs for critical actions.
- Metrics & analytics design for occupancy, revenue, disputes.

---

## Non-functional Requirements
- Persistence: PostgreSQL (relational data model).
- API: RESTful principles, JSON API contracts, OpenAPI/Swagger design.
- Security: input validation, authorization checks, rate limiting, data encryption at rest/in transit.
- Observability: structured logging, metrics (Prometheus), distributed tracing (optional).
- Performance & Scalability: horizontal scalability, DB indexing and caching strategy.
- Testing: unit, integration, contract tests, and CI pipelines.

## Current Deliverable

- File path: `features-and-functionalities/features_and_functionalities_overview.png`  
- Content: A visual diagram that categorizes requirements into:
  - Core Functionalities (User, Listings, Booking, Payment, Reviews)
  - Technical Requirements (Database, API, Auth, Observability)
  - Non-functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Scalability)

This PNG is intended to be the canonical high-level overview referenced by the remaining artifacts.

---

## How to use this deliverable

- Use the features overview image as the single source for scope conversations with stakeholders.
- From this map, derive concrete user stories and prioritize artifacts to produce (start with API specs and ER diagram).
- Convert each pending artifact into actionable tasks for engineers: e.g., OpenAPI schemas, DB migration scripts, test plans.

---

## Contributing

- Suggested workflow:
  1. Open an issue describing the artifact you want to work on.
  2. Draft locally, and raise a PR that updates the matching directory.
  3. Link diagrams and API specs to the Features & Functionalities overview for traceability.
- Naming conventions:
  - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `booking_flowchart.svg`, `api_bookings_openapi.yaml`).
  - Keep diagrams in vector format where possible (`.svg`) for clarity.
