# üè° Airbnb Clone ‚Äî Backend Documentation (alx-airbnb-project-documentation)

A System Analysis & Design (SAD) documentation package for the backend of an Airbnb-like application. This repository contains the pre-development artifacts required to turn high-level requirements into a developer-ready blueprint for a secure, scalable RESTful API.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

Deliver a complete, structured specification for a production-grade backend that supports:

- Secure user authentication and authorization (JWT, RBAC)
- Reliable booking and availability management
- Payment integration (Stripe) and financial flows
- Searchable, filterable property listings
- Reviews, notifications, and auditability

This documentation simulates a real-world SDLC where design, validation, and planning precede implementation.

---

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities & Technical Scope

The backend will include the following domains and technical considerations:

- User Management
  - Registration, login, password reset
  - Role-Based Access Control (Guest, Host, Admin)
  - Profiles and verification workflows
- Property Listings
  - CRUD for Hosts
  - Availability calendars, photos, amenities
  - Search, filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Booking Management
  - Reservation creation, validation (date conflicts), and cancellation
  - Booking lifecycle and statuses
- Payments & Financials
  - Stripe (or pluggable gateway) integration
  - Upfront payments, refunds, host payouts
  - Basic financial reporting and transaction records
- Reviews & Notifications
  - Post-stay reviews and host responses
  - Email and in-app transactional notifications
- Non-functional Concerns
  - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
  - Secure APIs (HTTPS, JWT, input validation)
  - Logging, monitoring, and basic rate limiting

## How to use this documentation

- Start with the Features & Functionalities Overview to understand scope and constraints.
- Review Use Case Diagram to identify actor responsibilities and system boundaries.
- Use the User Stories as the basis for backlog items and acceptance criteria.
- Once available, consult the API Specifications and Flowcharts to begin implementation.

---

## Next steps (planned)

- Complete the Data Flow Diagrams and Flowcharts to capture system behavior and edge cases.
- Produce formal API specifications (OpenAPI / Swagger).
- Add sequence diagrams and database schema migrations.
