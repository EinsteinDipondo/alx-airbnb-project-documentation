As an Unregistered User, I want to sign up using my email/password or OAuth (Google/Facebook) so that I can establish my identity and access core platform features like booking and listing properties.

2. Property Search and Filtering

As a Guest, I want to search for properties by location, specify a date range, and filter by price/amenities so that I can quickly find the accommodations that perfectly match my travel needs and budget.

🏡 Host Management

3. Listing a Property

As a Host, I want to create a detailed listing by providing a description, setting the nightly price, uploading multiple photos, and defining my availability calendar so that potential guests have all the necessary information to choose and book my property.

4. Managing Earnings

As a Host, I want to view a clear history of my earnings and automatically receive payouts so that I can manage my rental income efficiently without manual transaction tracking.

📅 Booking and Payment

5. Securing a Reservation

As a Guest, I want to create a reservation for selected dates and securely submit payment via the integrated payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) so that my booking is instantly confirmed and the dates are blocked for other users.

6. Providing Feedback

As a Guest, I want to leave a review and rating for a property only after the stay is complete so that future guests have honest, verified feedback to inform their decisions.

🛡️ Administrative Control

7. User Moderation

As an Admin, I want to view, audit, and manage user accounts (including changing roles or suspension) so that I can ensure platform safety, enforce policies, and maintain trust within the community.
